- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tadashitos
- 👀 I’m interested in learn some new languages, make new projects and discover new interests
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS3, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT, TYPESCRIPT, JQUERY, ANGULAR, VUEJS, PHP, LARAVEL and MYSQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you all need. But most of all, I want to keep learning more and more.
